## CpG Content Comparisons
This project focused on analyzing the CpG content among CDS regions and their upstream/downstream regions. Several plant species were compared and categorized as either "high" or "low" CpG species. 

CDS regions were normalized into 20 bins, with 2000 bp upstream and downstream regions included in the analysis. Interspecific comparisons were then conducted with various distance calculations such as Euclidean and Manhattan distances. 

### Visualizations

Several methods of multidimensional data visualization were conducted, including PCA plots, MDS plots, and t-SNE plots. 

The code for each of these is included, and scripts were developed for flexible use across other species.
